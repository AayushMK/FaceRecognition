#   This example program shows how to find frontal human faces in an image.  In
#   particular, it shows how you can take a list of images from the command
#   line and display each on the screen with red boxes overlaid on each human
#   face.
#
#   The examples/faces folder contains some jpg images of people.  You can run
#   this program on them and see the detections by executing the
#   following command:
#       ./face_detector.py ../examples/faces/*.jpg
#
#   This face detector is made using the now classic Histogram of Oriented
#   Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image
#   pyramid, and sliding window detection scheme.  This type of object detector
#   is fairly general and capable of detecting many types of semi-rigid objects
#   in addition to human faces.  Therefore, if you are interested in making
#   your own object detectors then read the train_object_detector.py example
#   program.
#
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the
#   command:
#       sudo apt-get install cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires Numpy which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install numpy
